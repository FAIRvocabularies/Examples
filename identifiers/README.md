# FAIR term identifiers

Examples of individual items from some vocabularies in the [domains described here](https://github.com/FAIRvocabularies/Examples/tree/main/domains) include: 

- ‘metres per second’ is defined in four different FAIR vocabularies, some of which use term-based local-ids, while others are opaque

  - http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M-PER-SEC 
  - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000094 
  - http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UVAA/ 

- [ANZ Soil Vocabularies](http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/soil/au/asls) use local-ids that concatenate a collection-name and item-code

- The FAIR [Geological Timescale prepared by GeoSciML](https://github.com/CGI-IUGS/timescale-data), and the [place-classification vocabulary](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/voc/ga/PlaceType) used in the Australian public sector, use the familiar name of the item as the local-id
