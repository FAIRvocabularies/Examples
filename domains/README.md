# FAIR domain names

Examples of persistent domains that are in use for FAIR vocabularies, which illustrate 

- **Rule 4.** Select a domain and service for the web identifiers. 

## Special purpose domains named for specific vocabularies 

- https://sweetontology.net/ 
- http://qudt.org/ 
- http://purl.obolibrary.org/

These domain names all relate to a vocabulary, not to an organization that created or maintains it. 

## A subdomain for a long-lasting initiative or organization 

- http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/ 

The primary URI for the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is now https://nerc.ukri.org. The original domain and sub-domain used for the NERC Vocabulary Service has been preserved, because it is relied upon by a large number of users from the global marine science community. 

- https://linked.data.gov.au/

The Australian Government is using a special sub-domain to host vocabulary and ontology resources, and associated linked datasets. 

- https://codata.id/  

CODATA is developing some vocabulary services for cross-disciplinary use, so has reserved a new domain specifically for this purpose. 

## Domains for a discipline or community collaboration, which are not tied to a single formal organization 

- http://anzsoil.org/ - for definitions proposed by various participant groups and organizations working with Soil information in Australia and New Zealand
- http://resource.geosciml.org/ - used for definitions for GeoSciML, which is a project of the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information
- http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/ - used for definitions used across both Australian Commonwealth and State geological surveys and equivalent
