# FAIR domain names

Examples of persistent domains that are in use for FAIR vocabularies include:

1. Special purpose domains named for specific vocabularies 

- https://sweetontology.net/ 
- http://qudt.org/ 
- http://purl.obolibrary.org/

These domain names all relate to the vocabulary, not the organization that created or maintains it. 

2. A specific subdomain associated with a long-lasting organization 

- http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/ 
- https://linked.data.gov.au/
- https://codata.id/  

The primary URI for the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is now https://nerc.ukri.org. The original domain and sub-domain used for the NERC Vocabulary Service (http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/) has been preserved, because it is relied upon by a large number of users from the global marine science community. 

CODATA is developing some vocabulary services for cross-disciplinary use, so has reserved a new domain specificlaly for this purpose. 

3. Domains for a discipline or community collaboration, which are not tied to a single formal organization
