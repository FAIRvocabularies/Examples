# FAIR domain names

Examples of persistent domains that are in use for FAIR vocabularies, which illustrate 
- **Rule 4. Select a domain and service for the web identifiers**. 

## Special purpose domains named for specific vocabularies 

- [https://sweetontology.net/](https://sweetontology.net/)
- [http://qudt.org/](http://qudt.org/)
- [http://purl.obolibrary.org/](http://purl.obolibrary.org/)

These domain names all relate to the vocabulary, not the organization that created or maintains it. 

## A specific subdomain associated with a long-lasting organization 

- [http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/ )
- [https://linked.data.gov.au/](https://linked.data.gov.au/)
- [https://codata.id/](https://codata.id/  )

The primary URI for the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is now [https://nerc.ukri.org](https://nerc.ukri.org). The original domain and sub-domain used for the NERC Vocabulary Service ([http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/)) has been preserved, because it is relied upon by a large number of users from the global marine science community. 

CODATA is developing some vocabulary services for cross-disciplinary use, so has reserved a new domain specificlaly for this purpose. 

## Domains for a discipline or community collaboration, which are not tied to a single formal organization 

- [http://anzsoil.org/](http://anzsoil.org/) - used for definitions proposed by various participant groups and organizations working with Soil information in Australia and New Zealand
- [http://resource.geosciml.org/](http://resource.geosciml.org/) - used for definitions for GeoSciML, which is a project of the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information
- [http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/](http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/) - used for definitions used across both Australian Commonwealth and State geological surveys and equivalent
